Hi! I'm **Abdurrahman Izzuddin Al Faruq** (or just **ruwwww** online), a 4th-semester undergraduate student in Information Systems at [Institut Teknologi Sepuluh November](https://www.its.ac.id/), Indonesia.

**Interests**

My primary interest is in **software engineering**, with a focus on backend development and **MLOps** — building the infrastructure and pipelines that bring machine learning models to production.

**Research Interests**

On the research side, I'm fascinated by **generative modeling**, particularly diffusion models and autoregressive models. I enjoy exploring how these architectures learn to model complex data distributions and their applications in various domains.

**Personal Interests**

Beyond computing, I have a deep appreciation for **physics** — from classical mechanics to modern theoretical physics. I'm also drawn to **high-performance computing (HPC)** and the challenge of squeezing every bit of performance out of hardware.
